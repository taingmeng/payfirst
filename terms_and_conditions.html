                that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
                of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the
                app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
                app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                to it, still belong to .</p>
              <p>We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
                the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
                never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying

                with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
